      <!-- Paragraph with embedded link -->
      <p>I was born in Pittsburgh, Pa but left when I was 4 years old and have spent most of my life residing here in South Florida. However, I have spent the last 7 years adventuring in New Orleans, Louisiana getting the most out of my liberal arts degree whilst I was there, i.e. bartending, serving coffee etc. Now it's time for me to return to my hometown, pick up new (marketable) skills, and take care of my aging parents. I am very excito be here. </p>
